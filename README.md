# AWS-Project

# Project Information
The purpose of this project was to get a better understanding of services offered by AWS.

Throughout this project, I've learned how to use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor services in:
* AWS Lambda
* AWS RDS
* AWS S3
* AWS EC2
* AWS VPC
I've also monitored the consumption of resources that each service in use had with its corresponding pricing.

While using AWS as my core infrastucture, I also wanted to explore how to interact with other API services.
This is where I decided to embed this project with the Google API -- focusing on Google Sheets API.

# Meal Tracker 
## Context
Prior to this project, I've been collecting data on foods & their nutritional facts such as:
*Type of Food
*Protien
*Carbohydrates
*Fat
*Fiber
*Serving Size
*Calories

This was primarly constructed to optimize my nutrientional intake to achive my fitness goals.
I've been collecting this data for ~3 months (10-12 weeks) in Google Sheets, so I decided an AWS project to hold the backend infrastructure to a long-term project.
